- Export as PNG in 3 sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
- Save them in the `icons/` folder

### Option 2: Use an online tool
- Go to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) or similar
- Generate icons with "SG" or a shield symbol
- Download and rename to: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

### Option 3: Simple placeholder
